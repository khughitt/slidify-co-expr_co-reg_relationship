## Overview

>- An important goal in biology is to understand the gene regulatory networks
   of various organisms.
>- There are now several high-throughput methods for querying the regulatory
>  relationships between genes, e.g.::
>   - ChIP-chip
>   - ChIP-Seq
>- In some cases, however, it is either not possible or not convenient to
>  collect this sort of data (e.g. Trypanosomes.)
>- In principle, genes which are co-regulated should show some similarities in
>  their expression profiles.
>- <span class='red'>Is it possible instead to infer gene-regulatory 
>  relationships from transcriptomic data such as Microarray or RNA-Seq?</span>
>- <span class='red'>Can functional information be used to improve this
>  inference?</span>

## Background

---

## Transcriptional regulatory networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Lee et al. 2002)

![Lee figure 1](assets/img/Lee_F1.large.jpg)

- Lee et al. describe an early use of chromatin immunoprecipitation
  with microarray technology (ChIP-chip) to query the targets of a set of
  known transcription factors in yeast.
- ChIP-chip limitations (likely improved since the time of writing):
  - Requires regulators (TFs) and target promoters to be known
  - Tagging doesn't always work (non-viable cells/inadequate expression)
  - False positives (~5-6% for high stringency cutoff)
  - False negatives (~33% estimated for same stringency)

## Transcriptional regulatory networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Lee et al. 2002)

![Lee figure 2](assets/img/Lee_F2.med.jpg)

- Regulator/promoter relationships are many-to-many:
  - Average of 38 promoters bound by a given regulator
  - More than 1/3 of promoter regions bound by 2+ TFs

## Results

---

## Co-expression and co-regulation

### Data sources

- Downloaded all public microarray data for *S. cerevisiae* (Stanford
  Microarray Database)
- Excluded genes with no known TFs:
  - 611 arrays
  - 2284 genes
- Downloaded Lee et al's TF binding data:
  - 6270 genes (4532 promoters)
  - 106 TFs

### Measuring co-expression

- Expression data median-centered over all arrays.
- Pearson correlation of expression profiles measured:
    - 2284 x 2284 symmetric matrix
